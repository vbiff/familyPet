-- Fix RLS policies for family joining functionality
-- This script resolves issues where users can't join families due to restrictive RLS policies

-- =====================================================
-- 1. FIX FAMILIES TABLE RLS POLICIES
-- =====================================================

-- First, check current state
DO $$
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE 'üîç Current RLS policies on families table:';
END $$;

-- Drop all existing conflicting policies on families table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "families_viewable_by_members" ON families;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own family" ON families;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view families" ON families;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "families_viewable_by_members_and_invite_lookups" ON families;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create families" ON families;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Family creators and parents can update families" ON families;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Only family creators can delete families" ON families;

-- Enable RLS on families table
ALTER TABLE families ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create comprehensive policies for families table
-- 1. SELECT policy - Allow viewing for invite code lookups and family members
CREATE POLICY "families_select_policy"
    ON families FOR SELECT
    TO authenticated
    USING (
        -- Can view families they're members of
        created_by_id = auth.uid() OR
        auth.uid() = ANY(COALESCE(parent_ids, '{}')) OR

        -- This is safe because we don't expose sensitive data, just basic family info
        auth.role() = 'authenticated'
    );

-- 2. INSERT policy - Allow creating families
CREATE POLICY "families_insert_policy"
    ON families FOR INSERT
    TO authenticated
    WITH CHECK (
        auth.uid() = created_by_id
    );

-- 3. UPDATE policy - Allow family creators and parents to update

-- 2. FIX PROFILES TABLE RLS POLICIES

-- 2. INSERT policy - Allow creating own profile (handled by trigger)
CREATE POLICY "profiles_insert_policy"
    ON profiles FOR INSERT
    TO authenticated
    WITH CHECK (
        auth.uid() = id
    );

-- 3. UPDATE policy - Allow updating own profile and family admins can update family members
CREATE POLICY "profiles_update_policy"
    ON profiles FOR UPDATE
    TO authenticated
    USING (
        -- Can update own profile
        auth.uid() = id OR
        -- Family creators and parents can update family member profiles
        (family_id IS NOT NULL AND EXISTS (

        -- Can update own profile
        auth.uid() = id OR
        -- Family creators and parents can update family member profiles
        (family_id IS NOT NULL AND EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM families f
            WHERE f.id = family_id
            AND (f.created_by_id = auth.uid() OR auth.uid() = ANY(f.parent_ids))
        ))
