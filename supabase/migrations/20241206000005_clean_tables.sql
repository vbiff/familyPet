-- Clean task comments first (depends on tasks)

-- We need to handle this circular dependency carefully

-- Note: We typically don't delete from auth.users as it's managed by Supabase Auth
-- But we can clean up any orphaned data

-- Re-enable triggers

-- You can run VACUUM manually after the migration if needed
