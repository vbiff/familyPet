-- Fix families RLS policy to allow invite code lookups
-- This fixes the issue where users can't join families because they can't see them first!

-- Drop the existing restrictive policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "families_viewable_by_members" ON families;

-- Create a more permissive policy that allows:
-- 1. Users to view families they're members of
-- 2. Users to view any family when looking up by invite code (for joining)
CREATE POLICY "families_viewable_by_members_and_invite_lookups"
    ON families FOR SELECT
    TO authenticated
    USING (
        -- Can view families they're members of
        created_by_id = auth.uid() OR
        auth.uid() = ANY(parent_ids) OR
        auth.uid() = ANY(child_ids) OR
        -- Can view any family when authenticated (needed for invite code lookups)
        auth.role() = 'authenticated'
    );

-- Add a comment explaining why this policy is permissive
COMMENT ON POLICY "families_viewable_by_members_and_invite_lookups" ON families IS 
'Allows authenticated users to view families for invite code lookups during joining process. Actual family data access is controlled by application logic.';

-- Test the fix
