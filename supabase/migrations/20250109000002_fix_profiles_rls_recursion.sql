-- Fix infinite recursion in profiles RLS policies
-- The issue is that policies are referencing the profiles table in a way that creates loops
-- This prevents family members from being loaded properly

-- Drop all existing policies on profiles table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_viewable_by_family_members" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_users_can_update_own" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_authenticated_users_can_create" ON profiles;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_users_can_view_family_members" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_users_can_create_own" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "profiles_users_can_delete_own" ON profiles;

-- Create new, simpler policies that don't cause recursion
