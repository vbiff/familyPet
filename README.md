## 🏗 Architecture

The app follows Clean Architecture principles with a feature-first approach:

```

### Architecture Principles

1. **Dependency Injection**: Dependencies flow inward only (presentation → domain → data)
2. **Pure Domain Layer**: No Flutter or infrastructure dependencies
3. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a single responsibility
4. **Testability**: Clean interfaces make testing straightforward

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.10.0 or later)
- Dart SDK (3.0.0 or later)
- Android Studio / VS Code
- Supabase account

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vbiff/familyPet.git
   cd familyPet
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Set up Supabase**
   - Create a new project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Copy your project URL and anon key
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
     ```env
     SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
     SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
     ```

4. **Set up the database**
   - Run the SQL scripts in `supabase/schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL editor
   - This will create the necessary tables and RLS policies

5. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## 🗄 Database Schema

The app uses PostgreSQL with the following main tables:

- **profiles**: User profiles with roles and family associations
- **families**: Family groups
- **tasks**: Task management with assignments and rewards
- **pets**: Virtual pet data and stats

### Key Features

- **Row Level Security (RLS)**: Secure data access based on user authentication
- **Real-time subscriptions**: Live updates for family activities
- **Enum types**: Task status, user roles, task frequency
- **Cascade deletions**: Proper data cleanup

## 🎨 Design System

### Material Design 3

The app implements Material Design 3 with:

- **Dynamic Color**: Adaptive color schemes
- **Surface containers**: Proper elevation and layering
- **Typography scale**: Consistent text hierarchy
- **Component tokens**: Modern button styles and navigation

### Key Design Principles

- **Clean and minimal**: Focus on content and functionality
- **Family-friendly**: Engaging colors and animations
- **Accessible**: Proper contrast ratios and touch targets
- **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes
